    <title>MA123 Quantitative Literacy</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In Quantitative Literacy, you will learn how to read, 
            understand, and interpret the numerical data that 
            permeates our lives. You will apply problem-solving 
            skills to make financial decisions, use proportional 
            reasoning to convert units, apply your knowledge of 
            percentages to multistage processes, apply the appropriate 
            amount of precision in making claims, recognize the 
            difference between linear and exponential growth, and 
            use two-way tables to analyze false negatives and false 
            positives. You will become aware of how mathematics may 
            be used by others to mislead you and how to ensure that 
            you are interpreting and presenting your results 
            honestly and accurately.

            f you are not majoring in Nursing, Education, or a quantitative 
            field, you have freedom in selecting the mathematics course 
            to satisfy your general education requirement.
            The course described here focuses on applying your algebra skills 
            to every day life decisions. For some students, this is an ideal course as
            they gain useful tools and appreciate math through its application. Other students may 
            already be familiar with these applications and find this course to 
            be less useful. Read on to see and try sample problems.

        <title>Am I ready for MA123 Quantitative Literacy?</title>
        <p>
            Before taking MA123, students will be expected to have prior proficiency in 
            performing operations on fractions, simplifying algebraic expressions, 
            solving linear equations, and working with percents and decimals. 
            Normally, the use of 
            a calculator is allowed in this course, but students need to 
            be able to convert word problems to algebraic equations, 
            recognizing how to input values and solve for the appropriate variable.
            Students needing 
            to strengthen these skills are encouraged to 
            consider starting in <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/>. 
            To test your readiness for MA123, you are encouraged to 
            attempt the problems in <xref ref="MR-exer"/> and then 
            check your work. You do not need 
            to be able to do the problems below in <xref ref="sec-MA123-LO"/>; 
            you will learn these skills and concepts
            during the course.

        <title>What will I learn in MA123 Quantitative Literacy?</title>
        <p> 
            At the end of MA123 (not now!), you should be able to do the following
            types of exercises. Calculators are allowed unless specified. These 
            problems are provided to give you a sense of what you will learn in this 
            course. You need only try enough of these problems to check that this  
            course will not be too easy and repetitive for you. If you do complete 
            problems, you are encouraged to view the provided answers and solutions
            after (not before) you finish each group of problems.

                    How do we define being able to do this problem? Speed is less important that reasoning

                    For b, we divide 86 by 88. Knowing how to do this  
                    type of problem means that you can read the two-way 
                    table and determine which values you need to divide to 
                    determine the probability. In addition, you may be asked 
                    to complete a partially-filled table.

                                We solve the equation <m>2P=P1.06^{t}</m>. We can divide 
                                both sides by <m>P</m>, leaving <m>2=1.06^{t}</m>. One way to 
                                complete this problem is to graph <m>y=1.06^x</m> and 
                                <m>y=2</m> on the same coordinate graph (using technology) to 
                                see where the curves intersect. To solve this by computations,
                                we would take a logarithm (log or ln) of both sides to get

            It is expected that most entering nursing majors will not be able to 
            do the problems in <xref ref="exercises-MA123"/> above. Unless you could 
            set up and complete nearly all of these, 
            you should decide whether this course  
            MA123 Quantitative Literacy or <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/>
            is the appropriate course for you. You can self-assess whether you would 
            benefit from taking <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> by trying the 
            exercises in <xref ref="MR-exer"/>. Choose
            <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> only if you need to develop skills in working with
            fractions, simplifying expressions, and solving linear equations. If you take MA100, 
            you will have no other electives in your nursing degree plan. Some skills 
            will be briefly reviewed in MA123, but with less depth and a faster pace 
            than in MA100. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you have a strong mathematics background? If you are a nursing major and can 
            complete nearly all of the 
            problems in <xref ref="exercises-MA123"/> on your own, 
            you might not be required to take a mathematics course and could be eligible 
            to take a free elective instead. 
            Since you will need to do problems similar to <xref ref="exercises-MA123"/>
            in your nursing courses and
            licensure exams, this waiver is only granted for students with exceptionally strong 
            math backgrounds. Your <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" 
            visual="asktheadvisor@rivier.edu">academic advisor</url> 
            and the mathematics program director will review your 
            request for a waiver of the mathematics requirement. If you change your major later, 
            you will need to fulfill the mathematics requirement to graduate.           
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have determined whether MA123 Quantitative Literacy, 
            MA100 Math Refresher is the better choice for you, return to the 
            Directed Self-Placement Survey to record your selection. If you 
            believe that you qualify for a waiver, select "Course above MA130" 
            on the Directed Self-Placement Survey.

        If you would like to explore other options, for completing your mathematics  
        requirement, you may look at

         or <xref ref="ch-Functions" text="title"/>. If you

        <xref ref="ch-MR" text="title"/> as 
        an option before making your decision.
