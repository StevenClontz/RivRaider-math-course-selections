    <title>MA123 Quantitative Literacy</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        In Quantitative Literacy, you will learn how to read, 
        understand, and interpret the numerical data that 
        permeates our lives. You will apply problem-solving 
        skills to make financial decisions, use proportional 
        reasoning to convert units, apply your knowledge of 
        percentages to multistage processes, apply the appropriate 
        amount of precision in making claims, recognize the 
        difference between linear and exponential growth, and 
        use two-way tables to analyze false negatives and false 
        positives. You will become aware of how mathematics may 
        be used by others to mislead you and how to ensure that 
        you are interpreting and presenting your results 
        honestly and accurately.

        If you are not majoring in Nursing, Education, or a quantitative 
        field, you have freedom in selecting the mathematics course 
        to satisfy your general education requirement.
        The course described here focuses on applying your algebra skills 
        to every day life decisions. For some students, this is an ideal course as
        they gain useful tools and appreciate math through its application. Other students may 
        already be familiar with these applications and find this course to 
        be less useful. Read on to see and try sample problems.
    </p>
    <p component="gen-ed">
        Other courses that may be used to fulfill the general education mathematics 
        requirement are MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability <xref ref="ch-Puzzles"/>, 
        MA127 Geometrical Explorations <xref ref="ch-GeoEx"/>, and MA130 Functions  
        <xref ref="ch-Functions"/>. Click on the links to learn more about these courses.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prerequisite for MA123 and other mathematics courses is the ability to perform 
        basic arithmetic and algebraic skills, to solve linear
        equations and simplify expressions, and to work with 
        fractions, decimals, and percents. Students needing 
        significant strengthening of these skills are encouraged to 
        consider starting in MA100 Math Refresher. A more detailed 
        description of MA100 with sample problems is available in <xref ref="ch-MR"/>.

                    your work. Round to the nearest penny per gallon.

                    How do we define being able to do this problem? Speed is less important that reasoning 
                    it out. Can you set it up and use your knowledge of multiplication and division of fractions? 
                    Searching for similar problems to mimic or looking at the 
                    solution does not count as knowledge of the topic.

            If you are unable to do the above problems on your own, 
            you should decide whether MA100 <xref ref="ch-MR"/> or 
            MA123 Quantitative Literacy is the appropriate course for you. Choose
            MA100 Math Refresher only if you need to develop skills in working with
            fractions, simplifying expressions, and solving linear equations. If you take MA100, 
            you will have no electives in your nursing degree plan. Some of the skills 
            will be briefly reviewed in MA123, but with less depth and a faster pace 
            than in MA100.

    <p component="nursing">
        If you are a nursing major and almost all the above problems seem easy for 
        you, you might not be required to take a mathematics course and could be eligible 
        to take a free elective instead. 
        Since you will need to do similar problems in your nursing courses and
        licensure exams, this waiver is only granted for students with exceptionally strong 
        math backgrounds.  Your 
        advisor and the mathematics program director will review your 
        request for a waiver of the mathematics requirement. If you change your major later, 
        you will need to fulfill the mathematics requirement to graduate.
