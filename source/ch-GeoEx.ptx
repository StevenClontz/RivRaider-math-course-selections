    <title>MA127 Geometrical Explorations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        MA127 is an exploratory, tactile course in which 
        students observe geometric relationships, make 
        conjectures, and test them. Topics include construction 
        and measurement of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional figures, 
        tilings, transformations, regularity, congruence and 
        similarity, and impossibility. Students practice 
        thinking outside the box, exploring why geometrical 
        formulas work, and making arguments that use diagrams 
        and words. The topics are chosen to help Education 
        majors prepare for the Praxis and similar licensure 
        exams, but students of all majors are welcome to develop 
        their tactile, visual, and verbal reasoning skills, to 
        strengthen their geometrical understanding, and to make 
        clear logic arguments. If you like building things and 
        making art, this might be a good fit for you.

    <p component="Education">
        If you will be teaching in the PK-6 setting, you will 
        be teaching geometry. Your licensure test will have 
        some geometry questions on it as well. This course 
        will engage you in tactile, visual, and computer 
        exploration in which you will observe and justify 
        geometrical patterns and properties. You will grow in 
        your understanding of why geometric properties hold, 
        build three-dimensional solids, and experience topics 
        beyond the typical curriculum like star polygons, 
        tilings, and fractals. Recommended both for students 
        needing to improve geometric skills and students wanting 
        to explore geometry from a different perspective. Perhaps 
        you can adapt activities from this class into lessons for your students.

        <title>What will I explore in MA127?</title>
        <p>
            Topics covered may vary, but often includes the following:
            <ul>

                    <p>
                       Determine the formula for the area of a trapezoid 
                       by cutting it up into rectangles, triangles, and/or 
                       parallelograms. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Explain why the Pythagorean theorem holds by rearranging 
                        triangles and squares into other shapes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Create tilings and quilt patterns and discover which regular 
                        polygons can be used to make symmetric designs.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Build three-dimensional solids with polygonal faces and explore 
                        the possibilities and patterns.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Determine which logos have reflective and rotational symmetry 
                        and discover the relationships between the angle of rotation and 
                        the number of reflecting lines.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Discover what happens when you reflect a figure across two lines 
                        in succession. When is it a rotation? A translation?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        What number patterns arise from the study of star polygons, 
                        kaleidoscopes, billiard ball paths, and fractals?

                    <p>
                        What happens to familiar geometrical properties when you create 
                        shapes on a sphere instead of a flat surface? Do they still hold? 
                        Are there other geometries other that Euclidean geometry?
                    </p>

    <title>Am I ready for MA127?</title>
    <p>
        To be successful in MA127, you need to be able to do basic 
        algebra including operations on fractions, working with exponents
        and square roots, plotting points on a graph, simplifying expressions, and 
        solving equations. You should be able to follow the steps in a task and think
        outside the box. Good writing skills will help as you learn how to develop 
        clear explanations and incorporate visuals and symbolic expressions. 
        Some fundamental topics such 
        as computing areas and perimeters, using the Pythagorean Theorem, and 
        the simplifying square roots 
        will be reviewed briefly at the appropriate time in the 
        course. Most importantly, 
        you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a "can-do" 
        attitude, a sense of curiosity, 
        and a willingness to explore ideas with others, 
        to notice patterns, and to give explanations.

        <title>Next Steps</title>
    <p>
        If you are ready to sign up for MA127 Geometrical Explorations  
        or have decided on another mathematics course,
        you may return to the Directed Self-Placement Tools and record your selection.
        If you would like to explore other options, for completing your mathematics  
        requirement, you may look at MA123 Quantitative Literacy <xref ref="ch-QL"/>, MA126 
        Puzzles, Patterns, and Probabilities <xref ref="ch-Puzzles"/>,
         or MA130 Functions <xref ref="ch-Functions"/>. If you 
        are concerned about your readiness for these mathematics courses, you may explore 
        MA100 Math Refresher <xref ref="ch-MR"/> as an option before making your decision.
