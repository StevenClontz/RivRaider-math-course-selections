  <introduction>
    <p>
        MA112 College Algebra reviews and strengthens a studentâ€™s 
        algebraic skills in preparation for MA130 Functions. Although it 
        counts as the Rivier University general education mathematics core 
        requirement, it is not recommended as a final mathematics course and 
        might not be accepted for transfer at other colleges.

        Topics include solving linear and polynomial equations and inequalities, 
        simplifying and evaluating polynomial, rational, radical, piecewise-defined, 
        exponential and logarithmic expressions, graphing linear and quadratic functions, 
        and solving applied problems and systems of linear equations.
