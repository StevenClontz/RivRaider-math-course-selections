    <title>MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, and Probability is one of several mathematics
        courses that may be chosen to fulfill the mathematics core complement 
        requirement. Other options include MA123 Quantitative Literacy 
        <xref ref="ch-QL"/>, MA127 Geometrical Explorations <xref ref="ch-GeoEx"/>,
        and MA130 Functions <xref ref="ch-Functions"/>.

        In MA126, the focus is on mathematical thinking and 
        open-ended problem solving. Creativity and logic will 
        serve you well as you explore some of the big ideas of 
        mathematics. You will explore the many patterns arising 
        from the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, â€¦, become aware of 
        the importance of prime numbers and remainders in our digital 
        world, learn what makes rational numbers so different from 
        irrationals, question whether there might be more than one 
        size of infinity, compute probabilities, stumble upon 
        paradoxes, and be introduced to some conjectures that have 
        not yet been proved to be true (or false)! If you enjoy 
        puzzles and games and figuring stuff out, this may be the 
        class for you.

        The content of MA126 may vary, but some of the questions below 
        are often explored:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                  If I could fold a paper in half 50 times, how high 
                  would it be?  
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Continue the sequence <m>3,4,7,11,18,\dots</m>. 
                    What do we notice about the ratios <m>\frac{4}{3},\frac{7}{4},
                        \frac{11}{7},\frac{18}{11},\dots</m>?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Why must there be an infinite number of primes? 
                    What role do prime numbers play in our digital world?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Is <m>\frac{\sqrt{56}}{\sqrt{14}}</m> a rational 
                    number? How do I write <m>23.154154\dots</m> as a 
                    fraction? 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the missing digit in the UPC code <m>02481000551</m>X?
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers: Are 
                    these sets of numbers the same size or are there different sizes 
                    of infinity?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    What is the probability that two people in the class share a 
                    birthday?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    How can I use logic and mathematics to ensure that I will win a 
                    two-player game? Does it matter whether I play first or second?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        To be successful in MA126, you need to be able to do basic 
        algebra including operations on fractions, converting between 
        units, simplifying expressions, and 
        solving equations. You should be willing to read word problems 
        and develop strategies to solve them. Some algebraic topics such 
        as prime factorization, long division, and the quadratic equation 
        will be reviewed briefly when introduced in the course. Most importantly, 
        you are expected to approach mathematical tasks with a "can-do" 
        attitude, a sense of curiosity, 
        and a willingness to explore ideas and 
        test out strategies with others.

        If you are ready to sign up for MA126 Puzzles, Patterns, 
        and Probabilities or another course you've researched,
        you may return to the Directed Self-Placement Tools and record your selection.
        If you would like to explore other options, for completing your mathematics  
        requirement, you may look at MA123 Quantitative Literacy <xref ref="ch-QL"/>, MA127 Geometrical 
        Explorations <xref ref="ch-GeoEx"/>, or MA130 Functions <xref ref="ch-Functions"/>. If you 
        are concerned about your readiness for these mathematics courses, you may explore 
        MA100 Math Refresher <xref ref="ch-MR"/> as an option before making your decision.
