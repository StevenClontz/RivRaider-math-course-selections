      Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey
      to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course.

        When you completed the first part of the survey, a course was recommended for you. You are encouraged to look at the description, 
        learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for that course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the
        course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links to explore other options. Then return to the 
        survey to record your selection. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation
        and use this information to develop your schedule.

        Rivier University students are required to take at least one mathematics course at the level of MA112 or 
        above. The mathematics courses satisfying this requirement encourage students to move beyond basic skills 
        and algorithms and enables them to apply mathematics to solving problems in various fields. Students will 
        see how mathematics can be used to discern truth, explore beauty, and understand our world and they will 
        be encouraged to think in ways that a computer cannot, making them more valuable in todayâ€™s world. Your major
        and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. 
        The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary 
        preparation yet still have more to learn. 
        This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful.

      In addition, you should also consider the benefits that these mathematics courses may 
      have for you and how they can contribute to your academic, professional, and personal 
      goals. Some courses focus on skill-building and applying mathematical content while 
      others may develop your problem-solving, reasoning, or technical communication skills.  
      You may be headed toward a career or graduate program where Calculus would enhance your 
      resume or you may benefit from discovering how mathematics underlies games, art, and other 
      less technical fields. In reality, most mathematics courses touch on all of these in some 
      way, but the table below gives an indication of what is emphasized in each course.
