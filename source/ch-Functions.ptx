    <title>MA130 Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        MA130 gives students the preparation they need to 
        succeed in calculus and to apply their knowledge 
        of algebraic and transcendental functions to other 
        fields of study. Linear, exponential, logarithmic, 
        trigonometric, polynomial, rational, and 
        piecewise-defined functions are examined from 
        symbolic, graphical, numerical, and verbal points of 
        view. Topics includeÂ sketching and analyzing graphs, 
        rates of change, inverses, and transformations of 
        functions. Applications to science, social science, 
        and business will be included. Students will be 
        encouraged to become more independent mathematical 
        thinkers as they solve problems.

        This course is not available for credit to students who 
        have successfully completed a collegiate course equivalent to MA 165 
        or higher. On the other hand, students who took a calculus
        course in high school which focused primarily on computations
        with little attention to theory and applications 
        may benefit from MA130.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prerequisites for MA130 are the same as the learning 
        outcomes for MA112. It will be assumed that students can
        simplify algebraic expressions, solve linear and quadratic 
        equations, work with exponents and radicals, compute the slope
        and give an equation of a line through two points, and work with functional 
        notation. Sample prerequisite problems may be viewed at 
        <xref ref="ch-CA"/> and will help you gage your readiness for 
        MA130. If most of these algebra problems in <xref ref="ch-CA"/> are 
        difficult for you, you might want to begin in MA112 instead of MA130.
