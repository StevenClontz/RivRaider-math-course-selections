      <title>About this Document</title>
      
      
      <p>
        Welcome to Rivier University! This document is designed to be used in conjunction with the self-placement survey
        to assist you in selecting your initial mathematics course. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Rivier University students are required to take at least one mathematics course at the level of MA112 or 
        above. The mathematics courses satisfying this requirement encourage students to move beyond basic skills 
        and algorithms and enables them to apply mathematics to solving problems in various fields. Students will 
        see how mathematics can be used to discern truth, explore beauty, and understand our world and they will 
        be encouraged to think in ways that a computer cannot, making them more valuable in todayâ€™s world. Your major
        and your mathematical history both play a role in identifying the mathematics course that is best for you. 
        The ideal course will be one where you feel comfortably challenged and where you have the necessary 
        preparation yet still have more to learn. 
        This type of learning environment is where you will be most engaged and successful. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you completed the survey, a course was recommended for you. You are encouraged to look at the description, 
        learning outcomes, and prerequisite skills for that course to verify that you were appropriately placed. If the
        course looks too easy or too challenging for you, follow the links to explore other options. Then return to the 
        survey to record your selection. Your advisor will look at your selection as well as your initial recommendation
        and use this information to develop your schedule.
