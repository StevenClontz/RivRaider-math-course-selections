            What should I do if I have possible college credit 
            (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate,
            Running Start, transfer credit)?

            As soon as you have your scores or transcripts, 
            contact <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu"

                What if I change my mind about my math course 
                or realize during the first week of the semester  
                that I am in the wrong course?
            </p>

            <p>
                The first week of each semester is considered 
                the add/drop period. During this time, students 
                may change their schedules with the assistance 
                of their advisor, provided there are available 
                seats in courses to be added. Courses that are 
                “dropped” during this period will not appear on 
                the student’s transcript. Be sure to talk to your 
                instructor about your concerns and to contact your 
                academic advisor to make any changes. Rearranging 
                your schedule does pose challenges though and you 
                are encouraged to act quickly if needed. You will 
                be expected to make up any work missed in your added 
                classes.
            </p>

                The add/drop deadline is posted on the academic 
                calendar.

            What if I can improve my mathematical skills between now  
            and the start of the semester? Should I sign up for a higher  
            course?  
        </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                If you need to learn the content of MA100 or MA112
                to take a subsequent course, you are 
                welcome to study mathematics over the 
                remainder of the summer with the intention of 
                enrolling in a higher course. There are many 
                online algebra resources available on the web. 
                You are encourage to consult the course textbook 
                as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you improve your mathematics skills and 
                want to be placed in a higher course, contact 
                <url href="mailto:asktheadvisor@rivier.edu" 
                visual="asktheadvisor@rivier.edu">academic advisor</url> 
                after you have studied the material. You may 
                find that the summer flies by quicker than 
                you anticipated or that learning on your own 
                is challenging. For this reason, we ask that 
                you select a mathematics course based on where 
                you are now, and then request a schedule change 
                if summer study makes a difference.
