    <title>MA100 Math Refresher</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        MA100 is designed to refresh and review your algebra
        knowledge and skills. The goals of this 
        course are to develop and strengthen the skills needed
        for subsequent courses in mathematics and other fields 
        and to build your self-confidence in using mathematics. 
        MA100 does 
        not fulfill the general education mathematics 
        requirement--you will need to take a second 
        mathematics course regardless of your majorâ€”but it 
        does count toward the credits needed for graduation.  
    </p>
      
    <p>
        Topics include computations with signed numbers, 
        fractions, and exponents; reading and solving word 
        problems; using algebraic properties to simplify 
        expressions and solve equations; graphing and 
        determining equations of lines; and solving systems 
        of two equations in two unknowns. Sample problems
        that you should be able to do at the end of the 
        semester are given in the next section. If you are
        able to do these problems now, you may be ready to 
        ready to take your general education mathematics
        course requirement without taking MA100. Read on!
